    <h1>My Preferred Tea of Choice</h1>
    <p> My preferred tea of choice would have to be ginger tea. Ginger tea is not only soothing <br>
        to drink, but also offers many benefits. One of it's many benefits includes digestive aid, <br>
        which means it can help with the digestion of food and the absorbtion and processing of <br> 
        micronutrients to the body. For this reason ginger tea is my preferred choice of drink, <br> 
        especially after a meal!
